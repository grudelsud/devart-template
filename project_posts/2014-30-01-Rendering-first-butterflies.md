#Rendering first butterflies
The rendering part of the project is done in three.js.
Our starting points were 2 three.js flocking birds examples: one that uses GPU power -> http://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_gpgpu_birds
and the other that make use of CPU power: http://threejs.org/examples/#canvas_geometry_birds

##Rendering
If in flocking birds algorithm, a bird is made out of two triangles, then for making a butterfly we use four of them.

![Butterflies](../project_images/flocking1.png?raw=true "Butterflies")

##Texture
The idea is to render unique or a number of different butterflies based on the sentiment of a wish. This, the rendering of unique entities we see as the biggest challenge at the moment.
