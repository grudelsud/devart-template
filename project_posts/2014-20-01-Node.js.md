# Getting our hands on Node.js
As mentioned in the previous post, one part of the Wishing Wall is a server. Since node.js is a great solution for a web server and it is in javascript, we decided to go for it. And in this way, we can have the majority of our code written in javascript.

A breakdown of things that needs to be done for Wishing Wall:

* install Node.js (http://nodejs.org/)

* install and connect MongoDB (database is needed for storing wishes and users, http://www.mongodb.org/)

* cookies for keeping sessions (we did with expressjs.com/)

* websockets for receiving new wishes -> socket.io library

* layout of received wishes (advance rendering of tables: pagination, search, sortering)

* sentiment analysis of a wish (https://github.com/thinkroth/Sentimental)

* add Web Speech API to store wishes in database

* authentificaation though google API (http://passportjs.org/)

![Authentification](../project_images/node1.png?raw=true "Authentification")

* create different roles for users and also different views (administrator rights, normal user)

* statistic of active users/visitors (to know the web traffic load)

* handling errors 404 and 403
